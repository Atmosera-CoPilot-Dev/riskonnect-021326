## Implementation and Testing with Jest in TypeScript

``` 
You are a TypeScript developer with expertise in Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Jest.
Create a 'Jest' unit test  for a TypeScript class 'WordMix'  that contains a public, static method 'palindrome'.
The method takes a string as an argument and returns `true` if the string can be read the same from right to left or left to right.
Details:
- The method should be case-insensitive
- The method should not consider spaces or punctuation
Examples:
- bob => true
- kayak => true 
- car => false
- A Santa at NASA => true
- go hang a salami I'm a lasagna hog => true
Response:
- Output  the contents of WordMix.ts as a TypeScript source file.
- Output the contents of WordMix.test.ts as a Jest test file.
