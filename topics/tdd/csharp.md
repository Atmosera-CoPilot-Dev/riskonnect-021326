## TDD with C#


```
You are a C# developer with expertise in Test-Driven Development (TDD).
- Provide a list of the top 3 unit testing frameworks for C# with a brief description of each.
- Order by popularity and community support.
- Include links to their official documentation.
```

```
Using the top unit testing framework you provided, create a unit test for a C# class 'Employees'.
- The class has a method 'HighEarners' that returns a list of employees who earn more than 100,000.
- The employee class has a name and a salary. The method should return a list of employees who earn more than 100,000.
Edge cases:
- The test should include a test case where the list is empty, and another where the list has one employee. In both cases, the method should return an empty list.
- The response must include the unit test and a sample Employees class with the HighEarners method.
```

```
Modify the Employees class to include a HighEarners method accepts a function expression (lambda) strategy in the form: (double) => boolean.
- Update the unit test class EmployeesTests to test the modified HighEarners method.
```
