When documenting REST API endpoints, follow this structure:
1. Start with the HTTP method and endpoint path
2. Add a brief description of the endpoint's purpose
3. List all request parameters with types and whether required/optional
4. Show an example request with sample data
5. Document the response structure with status codes
6. Include common error responses

Use clear, concise language and follow OpenAPI 3.0 conventions.
