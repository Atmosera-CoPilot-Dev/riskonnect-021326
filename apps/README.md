# Multi-Language Patterns Workspace

This workspace contains small illustrative projects in multiple languages, each demonstrating basic structure, patterns, or test setup. Use Copilot to explore and expand upon these examples.

## Folder Overview

- [c-sharp/ex1](c-sharp/ex1): Implements a Singleton-based logger in [`LoggerLib`](c-sharp/ex1/LoggerLib) with a test harness in [`TestLogger`](c-sharp/ex1/TestLogger).
- [c-sharp/ex2](c-sharp/ex2): Refines the singleton logger design with additional specs in [`specs.md`](c-sharp/ex2/specs.md) and validation via [`TestLogger`](c-sharp/ex2/TestLogger).

- [cpp/ex1](cpp/ex1): Demonstrates a banking scenario with requirements in [`README-bank-scenario.md`](cpp/ex1/README-bank-scenario.md) and story walkthrough in [`bank-scenario.md`](cpp/ex1/bank-scenario.md).
- [cpp/ex2](cpp/ex2): Showcases healthcare domain patterns and workflows (see folder for scenario files).

- [go/ex1](go/ex1): Basic Go program entry in [`main.go`](go/ex1/main.go) illustrating setup and execution.
- [go/ex2](go/ex2): Additional Go exercises expanding on patterns from ex1 (see folder for examples).

- [java/ex1](java/ex1): Java exercise scaffolding to practice core patterns (see folder for sources).
- [java/ex2](java/ex2): Follow-up Java exercise building on ex1 with extended structures.

- [python/ex1](python/ex1): Python exercise starter focusing on simple patterns and testing.
- [python/ex2](python/ex2): Continuation of Python patterns with more advanced examples.

- [ui/ex1](ui/ex1): UI exercise scaffolding for basic components and interactions.
- [ui/ex2](ui/ex2): Extended UI exercise with more complex UI patterns and states.
